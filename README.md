# ACM Research coding challenge (Spring 2023)

## IMPORTANT: Make sure to create a fork of this repo and share the link on your ACM Research Application Typeform submission. The coding challenge does not have to be completed at the time of you submitting the Typeform application (unless you completed the application last minute!)

Note: If it's getting down to the deadline (February 1st at 11:59 PM CST) and you don't think you will be able to finish your project on time, just complete whatever you have! Please do not work on the challenge after the deadline, but if you do need a few extra hours, make sure your challenge is done before interviews begin tomorrow (Feb 2nd).

This semester's challenge is especially open-ended. [Please refer to this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepu1109/star-dataset) on Kaggle called "Star dataset to predict star types".  It contains information about 240 stars and various properties taken from "Stars and Galaxies" by Seeds and Backman. Each row contains 7 pieces of information about a star, such as its temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, star type, star color, and spectral class.

Please note that the star type, denoted as integers, are translated as the following:
- Brown Dwarf -> Star Type = 0
- Red Dwarf -> Star Type = 1
- White Dwarf -> Star Type = 2
- Main Sequence -> Star Type = 3
- Supergiant -> Star Type = 4
- Hypergiant -> Star Type = 5

## INSTRUCTIONS: Please read this carefully, do not skim this!

### Here's the coding challenge: **What can you do with all of this data?** Yes, this is an **OPEN-ENDED** question and your answer should be a brief report, showcasing your skills. Can you find a pattern, answer a question, or create a visualization? In case nothing comes to mind, here are some ideas, with varying complexity:

- What is the most common star type in the data?
- What common patterns do you notice between any two properties? Ex: Is there a relationship between the star color and temperature?
- What properties are the most influential in classifying a star's type?
- Can you make a similar graph as the one shown in Kaggle to showcase the data as a Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram?
- Train a machine learning model to then predict the star type of a row of data (without the star type field) and find the model's accuracy.
Bonus: Can you find the row of data that most closely resembles our star, the Sun?

However, we strongly encourage you to come up with your own problem to solve! This is for you to showcase your skills!

You can use any programming language, framework, or library you want, but we recommend [creating a notebook in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks) and using Python. This will run in your browser, interlaces code with documentation, allows you to import the Stars dataset easily by pressing the "Add data" button, and gives you access to Python's high-quality, high-level libraries for working with data.
